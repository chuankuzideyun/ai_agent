# AI Agent

In this project, I build a fully functional AI Agent from scratch using **Python** and **LangChain**.  
The agent can interact with multiple large language models (LLMs) such as **OpenAI GPT** and **Anthropic Claude**, access various external tools, and produce **structured outputs** suitable for real-world applications or system integration.

## Features

- 🧩 Built with **LangChain**, enabling modular and extensible agent design  
- 💬 Supports multiple LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Claude, etc.)  
- ⚙️ Integrates with external tools and APIs for enhanced functionality  
- 🧱 Uses **structured outputs** for easy parsing and downstream usage  
- 🪄 Beginner-friendly and well-documented Python code
